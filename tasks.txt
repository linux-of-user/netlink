    * Details: Implement a robust, hierarchical key management system for backup encryption, potentially involving a root key secured by an HSM (from step 16) and derived keys for individual shards, with strict access controls and rotation policies.
    * Integration: Critical for the security of encrypted shards.

    Update Backup Documentation:
    * Action: Revise docs/backup-system.md and docs_internal/backup_nodes.md.
    * Details: Document the new sharding, encryption, distribution, and recall features in detail, including configuration options, security implications, and recovery procedures.

Phase 16: Massively Improved AI Abstraction Layer

    Integrate llama.cpp and bitnet.cpp Local Execution:
    * Action: Create src/plexichat/features/ai/core/local_model_runner.py.
    * Details: This module will manage the compilation (if necessary, or pre-compiled binaries), execution, and interaction with llama.cpp and bitnet.cpp binaries. It will use subprocess to run these executables, passing prompts and receiving outputs. Handle binary paths, model file paths, and resource management.
    * Dependencies: Requires llama.cpp and bitnet.cpp binaries to be present on the system. Add a check for these binaries during installation or runtime.
