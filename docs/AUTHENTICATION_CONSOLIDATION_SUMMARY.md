- **After:** Unified key management with hardware security module support
- **Impact:** Improved key security and rotation capabilities

### 4. Unified Threat Detection ✅
- **Before:** Scattered authentication monitoring
- **After:** Centralized threat detection and response
- **Impact:** Better detection of coordinated attacks

## Architecture Benefits

### 1. Maintainability ✅
- **Single Source of Truth:** All authentication logic in one location
- **Consistent APIs:** Unified interfaces for all authentication operations
- **Reduced Complexity:** Eliminated duplicate code and conflicting implementations

### 2. Scalability ✅
- **Modular Design:** Clear separation of concerns within unified system
- **Plugin Architecture:** Easy integration of new authentication methods
- **Performance Optimization:** Centralized caching and optimization

### 3. Testing and Quality ✅
- **Comprehensive Testing:** Single test suite covers all authentication scenarios
- **Code Coverage:** Improved coverage through consolidated codebase
- **Quality Assurance:** Consistent code quality standards

## Configuration Migration

### Unified Security Levels
The consolidated system maintains all security levels from the original systems:

```yaml
SECURITY_LEVELS:
  BASIC: 
    level: 1
    required_methods: ["password"]
    session_timeout: 60
    
  ENHANCED:
    level: 2  
    required_methods: ["password", "totp"]
    session_timeout: 30
    
  GOVERNMENT:
    level: 3
    required_methods: ["password", "totp", "biometric"]
    session_timeout: 15
    
  MILITARY:
    level: 4
    required_methods: ["password", "totp", "biometric", "hardware_key"]
    session_timeout: 10
    
  ZERO_KNOWLEDGE:
    level: 5
    required_methods: ["zero_knowledge", "biometric", "hardware_key"]
    session_timeout: 5
```

### Backward Compatibility
- All existing authentication APIs remain functional
- Configuration files automatically migrated
- Session tokens remain valid during transition
- No user re-authentication required

## Validation Results

### 1. Functionality Testing ✅
